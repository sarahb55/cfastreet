					Overview
				</h4>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/InstrumentWork.JPG" alt="Man working on a scientific instrument" /></span>
					The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) offers a unique opportunity for graduate students to pursue all or part of their thesis research at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA).  Since 1985, the SAO Predoctoral Program has hosted external graduate students from over 30 countries as well as from throughout the United States.  With unparalleled resources starting with world-wide observing and space-based facilities, graduate students often report that being at the CfA accelerated the pace of their research.   The CfA offers many opportunities to discuss and explore a wide range of career choices in astrophysics with over 300 scientists as well as over 200 fellowship recipients.  The Program offers each participant input from a research review committee and numerous opportunities to develop and strengthen their presentation skills.  Likewise, the Program strengthens collaborations between academic institutions.

				<h4>
					Program Specifics
				</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/predocsmeeting.jpg" alt="Group of students at a meeting having a discussion." /></span>The SAO Predoc Program offers an opportunity to work side-by-side with scientists at the CfA for appointments as short as 6 months or as long as 5 years.  SAO Predocs are mentored by a Predoctoral Research Review Committee comprised of 3 experts in the relevant research topic.  Students meet regularly in an SAO Predoctoral Journal Club where they practice presentation skills before professional research scientists and their graduate student peers.  The CfA promotes and organizes a series of professional development workshops throughout the year in addition to a daily array of seminars to meet the research needs of scientists at one of the most diverse centers for astrophysics research in the world.

				<h4>
					Benefits to Students and Faculty
				</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/ThreeAtScreen.JPG" alt="Three people working at a computer monitor." /></span> Home advisors are sent bi-annual or annual reports on student progress from the Director of the SAO Predoctoral Program.  The Predoctoral Research Review Committee is in frequent contact with the home advisor providing updates on the participant's progress toward research objectives.  Students and advisers also have the flexibility of extending their fellowships at any time.

					Faculty Feedback
				</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<i>“The SAO Predoctoral Program has been absolutely essential for expanding my student's professional network and providing her with access to top experts in her field of study. Indeed, the fact that she has a strong offer waiting for a postdoctoral fellowship is a testament to the quality of the training, mentorship, and network expansion that she has received through SAO Predoctoral Program.”</i><br />
					<br />
					Dr. Keivan Stassun, Vanderbilt University 
				</blockquote>
				<br />
				<blockquote>
					<i>“For me as a mentor, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Predoctoral Program is an excellent opportunity to develop and strengthen research collaborations with the incredible expertise present at the CfA.”</i><br />
					<br />
					Dr. JJ Hermes, Boston University 
				</blockquote>
				<br />
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>“I think the biggest impact of the SAO Predoctoral Program is the development of a high-profile Chandra science project as well as formation of a new collaboration that wouldn't have happened otherwise.  Overall, I believe that the SAO Predoctoral program has enabled the creation of a high-profile project, a strong and diverse team, and significant career development for a junior scientist.”</i><br />
